# Redis for API Caching

## Overview
Caching is an essential technique for optimizing the performance of web applications by storing copies of frequently accessed data in memory. As we have explored in the previous section, Redis is a popular in-memory data store that can be used with Django Rest Framework (DRF) to cache responses. In this tutorial, will explore how to integrate Redis for caching in a DRF project that interacts with an existing database
